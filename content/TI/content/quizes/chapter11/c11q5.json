                 "feedback": "Correct. Pascal's principle gives $\\frac{F_1}{A_1} = \\frac{F_2}{A_2}$, so $F_1 = F_2 \\frac{A_1}{A_2} = m g (0.15)^2 \\pi / (1.5^2 \\pi) = m g / 100$. The work done must be equal, so $F_2 h_2 = F_1 h_1$, and we get $m g \\cdot (10$ cm$) = m g h_1 / 100$, or $h_1 = 100 * (10$ cm$) = 10$ m."
