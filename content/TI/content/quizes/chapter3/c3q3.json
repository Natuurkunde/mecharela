Balance forces: $F_\\mathrm{z} = F_\\mathrm{n, nose} + F_\\mathrm{n, wheels}$. \n Balance torques: $F_\\mathrm{z} r_\\mathrm{z} = F_\\mathrm{nose} r_\\mathrm{nose} \n \\Rightarrow 80,000 \\cdot g \\cdot 2 = F_\\mathrm{nose} \\cdot 24 \n \\Rightarrow F_\\mathrm{nose} = 1 569 600 / 24 = 65400\\;\\mathrm{N}$."
