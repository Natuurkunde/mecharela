## Worked Examples

```{example} Momentum of an accelerated electron
Momentum of an accelerated electron: compute the momentum and speed of an electron after acceleration in a potential of $V=300\ \mathrm{kV}$.

From $E^2=(mc^2)^2+(pc)^2$ we have $p=\frac{1}{c}\sqrt{E^2-(mc^2)^2}$ and using $E=mc^2+E_{kin}$ we have
	
$$
	p=\frac{1}{c}\sqrt{2mc^2 E_{kin}+E^2_{kin}}
$$
	
With $E_{kin}=300$ keV and $m_e=511$ keV. The speed can be computed from rearranging $E_{kin} = mc^2(\gamma -1)$ to $\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1- \frac{(mc^2)^2}{(E_{kin}+mc^2)^2}}=\sqrt{1-\frac{511^2}{811^2}}=0.77$. Please observe how practical it is to use the units eV!

```{example} Decay of a neutral kaon
Decay of a neutral kaon into three pions. $K^0 \to \pi^- + \pi^+ + \pi^0$. Show that the three pions trajectories are in one plane.

In the rest frame of the kaon we have $\vec{p}_K=0$ before the decay. By conservation of momentum we have after the decay $\vec{p}_{\pi^-} + \vec{p}_{\pi^+} +\vec{p}_{\pi^0}=0$. A necessary and sufficient condition for three vectors $\vec{p}_1,\vec{p}_2,\vec{p}_3$ to lie in one plane is that $\vec{p}_1 \cdot (\vec{p}_2 \times \vec{p}_3)=0$ (Remember that this expression gives the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the three vectors). From the conservation of momentum we have $\vec{p}_1 = -\vec{p}_2 -\vec{p}_3$. Now we can compute $(-\vec{p}_2 -\vec{p}_3)\cdot (\vec{p}_2 \times \vec{p}_3)=-\vec{p}_2\cdot(\vec{p}_2 \times \vec{p}_3)-\vec{p}_3\cdot(\vec{p}_2 \times \vec{p}_3)=0$. The two terms are each zero individually as the term in the bracket is perpendicular to $\vec{p}_2$ and $\vec{p}_3$ respectively. 
	
If the trajectories in the rest frame of the kaon are in one plane, then they are also in one plane in all other frames. A coordinate transformation only shifts or rotates, which transfers a plane into a plane, but does not e.g. shear or bend a plane.

Prior to the disintegration, particle $M$ has 4-momentum:

$$P_i^\mu = \left ( Mc, 0 \right )$$

After the disintegration, we have two particles with 4-momentum:

$$P_{1,a}^\mu = \left ( \frac{1}{4}M \frac{5}{4}c, \frac{1}{4}M \frac{5}{4}\frac{3}{5}c \right )$$

and

$$P_{2,a}^\mu = \left ( m_2 \gamma_2 c, m_2 \gamma_2 u_2 \right )$$

From conservation of momentum we get:

$$\begin{split}
1 &= \frac{5}{16} + \frac{m_2}{M} \gamma_2 \rightarrow \frac{m_2}{M} \gamma_2 = \frac{11}{16}\\
0 &= \frac{3}{16} + \frac{m_2}{M} \gamma_2 \frac{u_2}{c} \rightarrow \frac{m_2}{M} \gamma_2 \frac{u_2}{c} = -\frac{3}{16}
\end{split}$$

Take the ratio of the last two equations:

$$\frac{u_2}{c} = -\frac{3}{11}$$

and from this we find

$$\frac{m_2}{M} = \frac{4\sqrt{7}}{16}$$

Thus, we see that the mass after the disintegration is $\frac{1}{4}M + \frac{4\sqrt{7}}{16}M \approx 0.911 \lt M$.

Before the absorption of the photon the 4-momentum is:

$$P_i^\mu = \left ( \frac{hf}{c}, \frac{hf}{c}\right) + \left ( mc, 0 \right ) = \left ( 2mc, mc \right )$$

After emitting the photon, the particle has mass $M$ and velocity $u$. The emitted photon has as frequency $\tilde{f}$ and 4-momentum $\left ( \frac{h\tilde{f}}{c}, -\frac{h\tilde{f}}{c} \right ) = (\frac{1}{4}mc, -\frac{1}{4}mc) $. The total momentum after the process is:

$$P_f^\mu = \left ( \frac{1}{4}mc + M \gamma c, -\frac{1}{4}mc + M \gamma u \right )$$

Since 4-momentum is conserved, we find:

$$\begin{split}
2mc &= \frac{1}{4}mc + M \gamma c \\
mc &= -\frac{1}{4}mc + M \gamma u
\end{split}$$

We rearrange the two above equations:

$$\begin{split}
M \gamma c &= \frac{7}{4}mc \\
M \gamma u &= \frac{5}{4}mc 
\end{split}$$

If we divide the second equation by the first, we have:

$$ \frac{u}{c} = \frac{5}{7} $$

The mass of the particle is:

$$M = \frac{7}{4 \gamma }m = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{6} \,m$$

Initially, the 4-Momentum is

$$P^\mu_i = \left ( M\gamma(v) c, M\gamma(v) v\right ) $$

with 
$$\frac{v}{c} = \frac{12}{13} \rightarrow \gamma(v) = \frac{13}{5} $$

After the decay, we have

$$P^\mu_f = \left ( m\gamma(u) c + \frac{hf}{c}, m\gamma(u) u + \frac{hf}{c} \hat{f}\right ) $$

with $\hat{f}$ a unit vector pointing in the $\pm x$-direction. We know $\frac{u}{c} = \frac{4}{5} \rightarrow \gamma(u) = \frac{5}{3}$. Conservation of 4-momentum now leads to:

$$\begin{split}
\frac{5}{3}mc +\frac{hf}{c} &= \frac{13}{5}Mc \\
\frac{4}{3}mc \pm \frac{hf}{c} &= \frac{12}{5}Mc
\end{split}$$

We still need to find out which direction the photon travels: parallel to $m$ or in the opposite direction. According to the above conservation of 4-momentum both seem possible. We require that in the above $f \gt 0$.

First we inspect the negative sign of $\pm$:

$$\begin{split}
\frac{5}{3}mc +\frac{hf}{c} &= \frac{13}{5}Mc \\
\frac{4}{3}mc - \frac{hf}{c} &= \frac{12}{5}Mc
\end{split}$$

If we solve for $f$, we get $f \lt 0$, which conflicts our requirement. That leaves us with the $+$sign:

$$\begin{split}
\frac{5}{3}mc +\frac{hf}{c} &= \frac{13}{5}Mc \\
\frac{4}{3}mc + \frac{hf}{c} &= \frac{12}{5}Mc
\end{split}$$

Solving for $m$ gives: $m = \frac{3}{5}M$. If we plug this back in, we find for the photon $hf = \frac{8}{5}Mc^2$.

The total 4-momentum before the collision is

$$P_i^\mu = \left ( 2m\gamma c, \frac{1}{2} m\gamma c,  \frac{1}{2} m\gamma c \right ) \text{  with  } \gamma = \frac{2}{3} \sqrt{3}$$

After the collision, we have only one particle with 4-momentum

$$P_f^\mu = \left ( M \gamma_f c, M\gamma_f u_x, M\gamma_f u_y \right ) \text{  with  } \gamma_f = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{u_x^2 + u_y^2}{c^2}}} $$

In this process, 4-momentum is conserved.

From $P^1$ and $P^2$ we get

$$\begin{split}
\frac{1}{2} m\gamma c &= M\gamma_f u_x \\
\frac{1}{2} m\gamma c &= M\gamma_f u_y
\end{split}$$

hence, $u_x = u_y$. The new particle moves over the line $x=y$.

If we combine $P^0$ with $P^1$, we find:

$$\begin{split}
2 m\gamma c &= M\gamma_f c \\
\frac{1}{2} m\gamma c &= M\gamma_f u_x
\end{split}$$

This gives $\frac{u_x}{c} = \frac{1}{4}$. Thus, the new particle moves with velocity $\vec{u} = \frac{1}{4}c \hat{x} + \frac{1}{4}c \hat{y}$. We find its mass by calculating $\gamma_f = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-2\frac{1}{16}}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{2}{7}} $ and using this in the $P^0$ equation:

$$ 2m\gamma c = M\gamma_f c \rightarrow M = \sqrt{\frac{14}{3}}m $$

a. In classical mechanics, we use -for this type of collision- conservation of momentum and of kinetic energy. This gives us:

$$\begin{split}
p: \,\,\,\,\frac{3}{5}m \frac{4}{5}c - \frac{4}{5}m \frac{3}{5}c &= \frac{3}{5}m u + \frac{4}{5}m U \rightarrow U = -\frac{3}{4}u\\
E_{kin}: \,\,\,\,\, \frac{1}{2}\frac{3}{5}m \left (\frac{4}{5}c \right )^2 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{4}{5}m \left (\frac{3}{5}c \right )^2 &= \frac{1}{2}\frac{3}{5}m u^2 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{4}{5}m U^2
\end{split}$$

This set has as solution (not surprising): $u = -\frac{4}{5}c, U = \frac{3}{5}c$.

b. Now we use 4-momentum conservation:

$$P_i^\mu = \left ( \frac{3}{5}m \frac{5}{3}c, \frac{3}{5}m \frac{5}{3}\frac{4}{5}c \right ) + \left ( \frac{4}{5}m \frac{5}{4}c, -\frac{4}{5}m \frac{5}{4} \frac{3}{5}c \right ) = \left ( 2mc, \frac{1}{5}mc \right ) $$

Note: the spatial part of momentum is thus non-zero, in contrast to the classical case.

After the collision we have:

$$P_f^\mu = \left ( \frac{3}{5}m \gamma_1 c, \frac{3}{5}m \gamma_1 u \right ) + \left ( \frac{4}{5}m \gamma_2 c, -\frac{4}{5}m \gamma_2 U \right )  $$

with

$$ \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{u^2}{c^2}}} \text{ and } \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{U^2}{c^2}}}$$

Next, we use conservation of 4-momentum: $P_i^\mu = P_f^\mu$. This is, however, hard to do analytical! Thus we use either a graphical or numerical method. If you do this, you will find:

$$u = - 0.7355c \text{\,\,\,\,\, and \,\,\,\,\,   } U = + 0.8050 c$$
